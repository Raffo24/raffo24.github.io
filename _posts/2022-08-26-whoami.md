# Raffaele Ruggeri

## üë®‚Äçüíª **Who I Am**

I am a **Cyber Security Specialist** with extensive experience in **Red Teaming** and **Penetration Testing**. I currently work at **Bip** in the Cyber Security department, where I simulate real-world cyber-attacks to test company systems' security and train defense teams.
## üéì **Background**

I graduated in Computer Science from **La Sapienza University of Rome** and have always been passionate about computing and Cyber Security. Today, I am part of the **Cyber Defense Excellence Center** at **BIP Consulting S.p.A.**, where I engage in highly technical activities across various areas of cyber security, with a particular focus on penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. 

In addition to my current role, I have previous work experience as an **Ethical Hacker** at **Aditinet Nomios** and as an **ICT Security Specialist at S3K**. During the years 2022/2023, I held the position of **evaluator in a CEVA laboratory** in the Cyber Security sector at **Sipal S.p.A**. 

I have sought challenging experiences over the years to immerse myself in the field I am most passionate about. Notably, I participated and reached the finals in the **CyberX - mind4future** training program competition, organized by **Leonardo S.p.A. and Cyber4.0**, which allowed me to expand my knowledge in the CyberSec field.
